WinWhois - a VB3.0professional only example client for the Whois protocol.

On RS.INTERNIC.NET/NIC.DDN.MIL, you can query quite a few interesting facts:
1) Try the first 2 parts of your I.P address (like 130.41 in an I.P address
    of 130.41.0.179).
2) Try typing in a company name (like Harris, FBI, CIA, or NSA ;)
3) Try typing in a government employee name that you know
4) Type in "?" for a list of commands

On most other whois servers, the daemon rarely amounts to little more than
an "egrep" on a flat-ASCII file. Try typing in "..." ;)
