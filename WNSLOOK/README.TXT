This is a sample DNS lookup program (a.k.a NSLOOKUP).

VB20: Text saved - written for the standard version. Uses "normal" controls.
VB30: Text saved - written for the professional version. Uses THREED.VBX.

Note: VB1.0 should use the VB2.0 example code just fine. You DO, however,
      need to copy the source into a form MANUALLY. VB1.0 does not have the
      "save as text" feature of VB2.0 and VB3.0 - and the author does not
      have VB1.0 to save the VB2.0 source in a format that it will accept.
      Just use a Notepad and cut-n-paste directly to a form.
